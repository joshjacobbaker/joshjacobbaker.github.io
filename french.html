       "He was as you and I, flesh and blood, breathing and thinking. <br>
        He bore the burdens we bare. He was tempted by the temptations we've been tempted by. <br>
        His friends and family, watched He was socially mocked and ridiculed, and laughed at. <br>
        He was whipped by a cat of  nine-tails, embedded with leaded balls, shards of glass and metal.<br>
        Nearly naked and dying, he carried a cross up the streets, while on lookers were either horrified or elated.<br>
        An african was ordered to help him carry the cross as He began to fall, bleeding internally, and aproaching death.<br>
        If He was God--what have we done? It wasn't JUST those who were present, but it's ME, you, all of us.<br>
        I don't know why everything is perfect, cause I'm not, but this, this is, and we're lucky to be a part of it.<br>
        If there was a God, this God would obviously be <em>CRAZY AWESOME<em> and highly intelligent--do we not see intelligence?<br>
        Let's look around, up and down, and see if we see ANY... pattern... Try and describe it. Is it in shape? Color? Mechanics?<br>
        "In the beginning, (time) God created the Heavens (space) and the Earth (matter)." - Genesis 1:1 <br>
         There was NOTHING, no time, no space (volume), nor Earth (matter) and then, by untold power, EVERYTHING.<br>
         I can articulately outline SO MUCH more, to better explain WHY I believe in JESUS as YHWH, the God of the Universe<br>
         but I still have so many questions, for now, it's time for us to humble ourselves, and continue asking questions.<br>
         <br>
         They say He rose again, then, for some strange reason, His friends who denied Him, willingly were slaughtered--what convinced them?
